# Fingerprint-Unlocking-Door-System
This project implements a biometric door unlocking system that uses fingerprint authentication to ensure secure access. 
The system stores authorized usersâ€™ fingerprints and unlocks the door only when a valid fingerprint is detected, thereby preventing unauthorized entry. 
To enhance security, the system also integrates a buzzer and LED indicators that provide real-time alerts in case of failed or unauthorized access attempts. 
Built using Arduino, fingerprint sensor modules, and solenoid locks, this solution automates door control, improves reliability, and offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional lock-and-key mechanisms.
